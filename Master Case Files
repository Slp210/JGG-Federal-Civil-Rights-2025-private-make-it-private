**This checklist is ready to use. You can print it, check off each box as you complete it, and use it to organize your federal filing to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.**En banc
French meaning “on the bench” or “as a full bench.” Refers to court sessions with the entire membership of a court participating. U.S. circuit courts of appeals usually decide matters sitting in panels of three judges. However, all the judges in the court may decide certain matters together or review panel decisions sitting “en banc” (occasionally spelled “in banc”). The largest courts of appeals may split their full membership into two en banc panels. 

Equitable
Pertaining to civil suits in "equity" rather than in "law." In English legal history, the courts of "law" could order the payment of damages and could afford no other remedy (see damages). A separate court of "equity" could order someone to do something or to cease to do something (e.g., injunction). In American jurisprudence, the federal courts have both legal and equitable power, but the distinction is still an important one. For example, a trial by jury is normally available in "law" cases but not in "equity" cases. 

Equity
The value of a debtor's interest in property that remains after liens and other creditors' interests are considered. (Example: If a house valued at $100,000 is subject to a $80,000 mortgage, there is $20,000 of equity.) 

Evidence
Any material, object, or information presented in testimony or in documents that is used to persuade the fact finder (judge or jury) to decide the case in favor of one side or the other. The federal courts must follow the Federal Rules of Evidence. 

Ex parte
A proceeding brought before a court by one party only, without notice to or challenge by the other side. 

Exclusionary rule
Doctrine that says evidence obtained in violation of a criminal defendant's constitutional or statutory rights is not admissible at trial. 

Exculpatory evidence
Evidence indicating that a defendant did not commit the crime. 

Executory contracts
A contract under which both parties have material duties remaining to be performed. If a contract is executory, a debtor may assume or reject it, subject to court approval. See “assume.” 

Exempt assets
Property that a debtor is allowed to retain, free from the claims of creditors who do not have liens on the property.

Exemptions, exempt property
Certain property owned by an individual debtor that the Bankruptcy Code or applicable state law permits the debtor to keep from unsecured creditors. For example, in some states the debtor may be able to exempt all or a portion of the equity in the debtor's primary residence (homestead exemption), or some or all "tools of the trade" used by the debtor to make a living (i.e., auto tools for an auto mechanic or dental tools for a dentist). The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends on the state the debtor lives in. 

F
Family farmer
An individual, individual and spouse, corporation, or partnership engaged in a farming operation that meets certain debt limits and other statutory criteria for filing a petition under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code.  

Federal public defender
An attorney employed by the federal courts on a full-time basis to provide legal defense to defendants who are unable to afford counsel.  

Federal public defender organization
As provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, an organization established within a federal judicial circuit to represent criminal defendants who cannot afford an adequate defense. Each organization is supervised by a federal public defender appointed by the court of appeals for the circuit. 

Federal question jurisdiction
Jurisdiction given to federal courts in cases involving the interpretation and application of the U.S. Constitution, acts of Congress, and treaties. 

Felony
A serious crime carrying a penalty of more than one year in prison. See “misdemeanor.” 

File
(1) The act of transmitting or placing a document in the official custody of the clerk of court and entering it into the file or record of a case;  

(2) the official record of a case. 

Financial management
The "individual or group briefing" from an approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency that individual debtors must attend after the bankruptcy case is filed in order to obtain a discharge. There are exceptions to this requirement for certain categories of debtors if the U.S. Trustee or Bankruptcy Administrator have determined that there are insufficient approved credit counseling agencies available to provide the necessary counseling. These agencies are approved by the U.S. trustee or the bankruptcy administrator. See "Credit counseling.” 

Fraudulent transfer
A transfer of a debtor's property made with intent to defraud or for which the debtor receives less than the transferred property's reasonably equivalent value.
